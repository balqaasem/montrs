## 🏗️ Core Concepts

- **Determinism**: Every part of MontRS is designed to be predictable and testable in isolation.
- **Model-First**: We prioritize machine-readable metadata to enable agent-assisted development.
- **Trait-Driven**: Interfaces are defined by traits, allowing for modular and swappable components.
