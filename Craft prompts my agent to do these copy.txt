Craft prompts my agent to do these:
1. Create an agent “capabilities sandbox”
2. Design a montrs agent doctor command
3. Create a doc linting checklist
4. Create a “When Not to Use MontRS” doc (hugely valuable)
5. Design agent validation rules that auto-reject bad PRs
6. Allow CLI to Generate CLI error messages that reference our rules and recommendations.
7. Create a router linting spec for future tooling
8. Align and Merge this into our router PRD and CLI UX
9. Create documentation for guidelines for creating and building MontRS new packages FOR CONTRIBUTORS OF MontRS.

11. Rename Modules to Plates (COMPLETED). rename `modules` to `plates` - The tectonic plates of the Nountain (Mont RS) "pun intended'. Modules are to MontRS what pallets are to Substrate.

13. Rename our agent-first strategy (COMPLETED). Because in the future, we will build an ai-sdk and I don't want to have conflicts between these anywhere, neither in docs nor in code.
