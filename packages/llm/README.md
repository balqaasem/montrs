# montrs-llm

The AI-First logic engine for MontRS.

**Target Audiences:** Framework Contributors, AI Agents.

## 1. What this package is
`montrs-llm` is the package responsible for making MontRS applications machine-readable. It handles the generation of project snapshots, versioned error tracking, and tool curation.

## 2. What problems it solves
- **Context Fragmentation**: Aggregates disparate information (source code, READMEs, CLI metadata) into a single, structured `llm.json` file.
- **Debugging Blind Spots**: Captures full error context (including compiler output and suggested fixes) into versioned `errorfiles`.
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatically maps CLI commands and package capabilities to AI-native tool specifications.

## 3. What it intentionally does NOT do
- **AI Inference**: It does not call LLM APIs or perform inference; it only prepares the data for them.
- **Code Modification**: It provides the data for fixes (diffs) but does not apply them to the source code (the CLI or the developer does that).
- **Core Logic**: It does not define how modules or routes work (see `montrs-core`).

## 4. How it fits into the MontRS system
It acts as a **sidecar** to the CLI. While the CLI handles the "doing," `montrs-llm` handles the "describing" and "recording."

## 5. When a user should reach for this package
- When building a custom AI agent that needs to understand a MontRS project.
- When extending the framework with new machine-readable metadata.
- When implementing a new error reporting or diagnostics system.

## 6. Deeper Documentation
- [AI Specification Reference](../../The%20AI%20Specfication.md)
- [Snapshot Structure Guide](../../docs/spec.md)
- [Error Tracking Lifecycle](../../docs/errors.md)

## 7. Notes for AI Agents
- **Self-Documentation**: This package is the primary source of truth for your own capabilities within a MontRS project.
- **Snapshot Origin**: All data in `.llm/llm.json` is generated by the `LlmManager` in this package.
- **Diff Training**: The `errorfiles` in this package contain historical diffs of fixed bugs, which are highly valuable for understanding local patterns.
